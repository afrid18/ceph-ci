# Requirements for the cephadm zipapp (aka the binary).
#
# IMPORTANT: The cephadm binary is expected to be portable across python
# versions and CPU architectures. Dependencies are copied into the zipapp
# by the build script and must not require compiled C (or C++, Rust, etc)
# modules. Modules that have an optional C accelerator but can fall back
# to pure python are OK. When you add a package to this list verify that
# build.py creates the zipapp with only python files.
