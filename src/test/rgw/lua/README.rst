====================
 Lua Scripting Tests
====================

You will need to use the sample configuration file named ``luatests.conf.SAMPLE``
that has been provided at ``/path/to/ceph/src/test/rgw/lua/``. You can also copy this file to the directory where you are
running the tests and modify it if needed. This file can be used to run the RGW lua scripting tests on a Ceph cluster started
with the `vstart.sh` script.
